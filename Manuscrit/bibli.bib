	abstract = {The goal of the thesis is to develop and improve methods for defeating protected cryptosystems. A new signal decompositionalgorithm, called Hilbert Huang Transform, was adapted to increase the efficiency of side-channel attacks. This technique attempts to overcome hiding countermeasures, such as operation shuffling or the adding of noise to the power consumption. The second contribution of this work is the application of specific Hamming weight distributions of block cipher algorithms, including AES, DES, and LED. These distributions are distinct for each subkey value, thus they serve as intrinsic templates. Hamming weight data can be revealed by side-channel and fault attacks without plaintext and ciphertext. Therefore these distributions can be applied against implementations where plaintext and ciphertext are inaccessible. This thesis shows that some countermeasures serve for attacks. Certain infective RSA countermeasures should protect against single fault injection. However, additional computations facilitate key discovery. Finally, several lightweight countermeasures are proposed. The proposed countermeasures are based on the antagonist masking, which is an operation occurring when targeting data processing, to intelligently mask the overall power consumption.},

Additionally a low energy countermeasure for symmetric key cryptography is presented which avoids large overheads of table regeneration or excessive storage.

We investigate the leakage of processed data by passively measuring the dissipated heat of the devices. The temperature leakage is thereby linearly correlated with the power leakage model but is limited by the physical properties of thermal conductivity and capacitance. We further present heating faults by operating the devices beyond their specified temperature ratings. The efficiency of this kind of attack is shown by a practical attack on an RSA implementation. Finally, we introduce data remanence attacks on AVR microcontrollers that exploit the Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) property of internal SRAM cells. We show how to recover parts of the internal memory and present first results on an ATmega162. The work encourages the awareness of temperature-based attacks that are known for years now but not well described in literature.

	abstract = {Many computers emit a high-pitched noise during operation, due to vibration in some of their electronic components. These acoustic emanations are more than a nuisance: They can convey information about the software running on the computer and, in particular, leak sensitive information about security-related computations. In a preliminary presentation (Eurocrypt’04 rump session), we have shown that different RSA keys induce different sound patterns, but it was not clear how to extract individual key bits. The main problem was the very low bandwidth of the acoustic side channel (under 20  kHz using common microphones, and a few hundred kHz using ultrasound microphones), and several orders of magnitude below the GHz-scale clock rates of the attacked computers. In this paper, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack, applicable to GnuPG’s implementation of RSA. The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate such attacks, using a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 10 meters away.},

For the key extraction we present a ‘minimum principle’ that solely uses deterministic data dependencies and the ‘maximum likelihood principle’ that additionally incorporates the characterization of the noise revealed during profiling. The theoretical predictions are accompanied and confirmed by experiments. We demonstrate that the adaptation of probability densities is clearly advantageous regarding the correlation method, especially, if multiple leakage signals at different times can be jointly evaluated. Though our efficiency at key extraction is limited by template attacks profiling is much more efficient which is highly relevant if the designer of a cryptosystem is bounded by the number of measurements in the profiling step.},

Appropriate evaluation tools and metrics are required to understand the origin of implementation flaws within the design process. The selected leakage model has significant influence on the reliability of evaluation results concerning the side-channel resistance of a cryptographic implementation. In this contribution we introduce methods, which determine the accuracy of the leakage characterization and allow to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio. This allows a quantitative assessment of the side-channel resistance of an implementation without launching an attack. We validate the conclusions drawn from our new methods by real attacks and obtain similar results.

	abstract = {Differential power analysis is a powerful cryptanalytic technique that exploits information leaking from physical implementations of cryptographic algorithms. During the two last decades, numerous variations of the original principle have been published. In particular, the univariate case, where a single instantaneous leakage is exploited, has attracted much research effort. In this paper, we argue that several univariate attacks among the most frequently used by the community are not only asymptotically equivalent, but can also be rewritten one in function of the other, only by changing the leakage model used by the adversary. In particular, we prove that most univariate attacks proposed in the literature can be expressed as correlation power analyses with different leakage models. This result emphasizes the major role plays by the model choice on the attack efficiency. In a second point of this paper, we hence also discuss and evaluate side channel attacks that involve no leakage model but rely on some general assumptions about the leakage. Our experiments show that such attacks, named robust, are a valuable alternative to the univariate differential power analyses. They only loose bit of efficiency in case a perfect model is available to the adversary, and gain a lot in case such information is not available.},

In this paper, we present a more general and feasible reverse analysis by combining the mathematical methods and the SCA methods. We use the strict avalanche criterion for the non-linear operations of block ciphers and apply the power analysis to reverse the structure parameters. We propose a new reverse analysis method to reduce the dependency on the leakage models, which can be combined with the structure cryptanalysis to reverse the internal parameters of the linear and non-linear operations.

Masked algorithms are often expected to provide, at least, a certain level of probing security. Leveraging the deep connections between probabilistic information flow and probing security, we develop a precise, scalable, and fully automated methodology to verify the probing security of masked algorithms, and generate them from unprotected descriptions of the algorithm. Our methodology relies on several contributions of independent interest, including a stronger notion of probing security that supports compositional reasoning, and a type system for enforcing an expressive class of probing policies.

On the other hand, splitting sensitive variables in a multiplicative way is more amenable for the computation of the AES S-box, as noted by Akkar and Giraud. However, multiplicative masking needs to be implemented carefully not to be vulnerable to first-order DPA with a zero-value power model. Up to now, sound higher-order multiplicative masking schemes have been implemented only in software. In this work, we demonstrate the first hardware implementation of AES using multiplicative masks. The method is tailored to be secure even if the underlying gates are not ideal and glitches occur in the circuit. We detail the design process of first- and second-order secure AES-128 cores, which result in the smallest die area to date among previous state-of-the-art masked AES implementations with comparable randomness cost and latency. The first- and second-order masked implementations improve resp. 29\% and 18\% over these designs. We deploy our construction on a Spartan-6 FPGA and perform a side-channel evaluation. No leakage is detected with up to 50 million traces for both our first- and second-order implementation. For the latter, this holds both for univariate and bivariate analysis.},

We show that this single condition includes, but is not limited to, previous security notions such as those used in higher-order threshold implementations and in abstractions using ideal gates. As opposed to these previously known necessary conditions, our new condition is also sufficient. On the other hand, it excludes avoidable notions such as uniformity. We also treat the notion of (strong) noninterference from an information-theoretic point-of-view in order to unify the different security concepts and pave the way to the verification of composability in the presence of glitches. We conclude the paper by demonstrating how the condition can be used as an efficient and highly generic flaw detection mechanism for a variety of functions and schemes based on different operations.},

Since then, several methods, such as Wave Dynamic Differential Logic (WDDL) and Masked Dual-Rail Pre-charge Logic (MDPL), have been presented to make circuits clean. In this paper, we propose a more accurate power model based on logic gates’ output transitions and divide it into pieces according to input signals’ transformations. Based on our model, we demonstrate that 1-bit masked logic gates with asynchronous inputs always leak side-channel information from their output transitions. Therefore, even those gates designed without glitches are still susceptible to be attacked. To solve this problem, Dual-Rail Random Switching Logic (DRSL) is presented. By introducing a local pre-charge signal, DRSL gates have their inputs synchronized. Experimental results indicate that DRSL eliminates most of the leakage.},

To counteract it, masking schemes are usually involved which randomize key-dependent data by the addition of one or several random value(s) (the masks). When dth-order masking is involved (i.e. when d masks are used per key-dependent variable), the complexity of performing an SCA grows exponentially with the order d. The design of generic dth-order masking schemes taking the order d as security parameter is therefore of great interest for the physical security of cryptographic implementations. This paper presents the first generic dth-order masking scheme for AES with a provable security and a reasonable software implementation overhead. Our scheme is based on the hardware-oriented masking scheme published by Ishai et al. at Crypto 2003. Compared to this scheme, our solution can be efficiently implemented in software on any general-purpose processor. This result is of importance considering the lack of solution for d ≥ 3.},

The analysis reveals that these glitches are caused by the switching characteristics of XOR gates in masked multipliers. Masked multipliers are basic building blocks of most recent proposals for masked AES S-boxes. We subsequently show that the side-channel leakage of the masked multipliers can be prevented by fulfilling timing constraints for 3 \${\textbackslash}textperiodcentered\$n XOR gates in each GF(2n) multiplier of an AES S-box. We also briefly present two approaches on how these timing constraints can be fulfilled in practice.},

In this talk, we demonstrate how the costs for protecting digital circuits against passive physical attacks can be lowered significantly. We introduce a novel masking approach called domain-oriented masking (DOM). Our approach provides the same level of security as threshold implementations (TI), while it requires less chip area and less randomness. DOM can also be scaled easily to arbitrary protection orders for any circuit. To demonstrate the flexibility of our scheme, we apply DOM to a hardware design of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The presented AES implementation is built in a way that it can be synthesized for any protection order. Although our AES design is scalable, it is smaller, faster, and less randomness demanding than other side-channel protected AES implementations. Our first-order secure AES design, for example, requires only 18 bits of randomness per S-box operation and 6 kGE of chip area. We demonstrate the flexibility of our AES implementation by synthesizing it up to the 15th protection order. Beside our theoretical security analysis, we also evaluate the security of the AES implementation with a t-test based side-channel leakage assessments up to the second protection order.

	abstract = {The continually growing number of security-related autonomous devices requires efficient mechanisms to counteract low-cost side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks. Masking provides high SCA resistance at an adjustable level of security. A high level of resistance, however, goes hand in hand with an increasing demand for fresh randomness which drastically increases the implementation costs. Since hardware-based masking schemes have other security requirements than software masking schemes, the research in these two fields has been conducted quite independently over the last 10 years. One important practical difference is that recently published software schemes achieve a lower randomness footprint than hardware masking schemes. In this work we combine existing software and hardware masking schemes into a unified masking algorithm. We demonstrate how to protect software and hardware implementations using the same masking algorithm, and for lower randomness costs than the separate schemes. Especially for hardware implementations, the randomness costs can in some cases be halved over the state of the art. Theoretical considerations as well as practical implementation results are then used for a comparison with existing schemes from different perspectives and at different levels of security.},

For this purpose, we first argue that (i) the probing model is not straightforward to interpret, since it more naturally captures the intuitions of serial implementations, and (ii) the noisy leakage model is not always convenient, e.g. when combined with formal methods for the verification of cryptographic implementations. Therefore we introduce a new model, the bounded moment model, that formalizes a weaker notion of security order frequently used in the side-channel literature. Interestingly, we prove that probing security for a serial implementation implies bounded moment security for its parallel counterpart. This result therefore enables an accurate understanding of the links between formal security analyses of masking schemes and experimental security evaluations based on the estimation of statistical moments. Besides its consolidating nature, our work also brings useful technical contributions. First, we describe and analyze refreshing and multiplication algorithms that are well suited for parallel implementations and improve security against multivariate side-channel attacks. Second, we show that simple refreshing algorithms (with linear complexity) that are not secure in the continuous probing model are secure in the continuous bounded moment model. Eventually, we discuss the independent leakage assumption required for masking to deliver its security promises, and its specificities related to the serial or parallel nature of an implementation.},

	abstract = {Masking requires splitting sensitive variables into at least {\textbackslash}(d+1{\textbackslash}) shares to provide security against DPA attacks at order d. To this date, this minimal number has only been deployed in software implementations of cryptographic algorithms and in the linear parts of their hardware counterparts. So far there is no hardware construction that achieves this lower bound if the function is nonlinear and the underlying logic gates can glitch. In this paper, we give practical implementations of the AES using {\textbackslash}(d+1{\textbackslash}) shares aiming at first- and second-order security even in the presence of glitches. To achieve this, we follow the conditions presented by Reparaz et al. at CRYPTO 2015 to allow hardware masking schemes, like Threshold Implementations, to provide theoretical higher-order security with {\textbackslash}(d+1{\textbackslash}) shares. The decrease in number of shares has a direct impact in the area requirements: our second-order DPA resistant core is the smallest in area so far, and its S-box is {\textbackslash}(50{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash}) smaller than the current smallest Threshold Implementation of the AES S-box with similar security and attacker model. We assess the security of our masked cores by practical side-channel evaluations. The security guarantees are met with 100 million traces.},

We observe that the effects of fault injection on two-stage pipeline devices are more complex than commonly reported in the literature. While injecting a fault is relatively easy, injecting an exploitable fault is hard. We further observe that the easiest to inject and reliable fault is to replace instructions, and that random faults do not occur. Finally we explain how typical fault attacks can be mounted on this device, and describe a new attack for which the fault injection is easy and the cryptanalysis trivial.},

The obtained faults were compared to faults injected by clock glitches. As a result, both power and clock glitch induced faults were found to be identical. Because clock glitches are related to timing constraint violations, we shall consider that both power and clock glitches share this common fault injection mechanism.

The attack typically aims at skipping security checks or generating side-channels that gradually leak sensitive data, including the firmware code. In this paper we propose a new voltage fault injection technique that generates fully arbitrary voltage glitch waveforms using off-the-shelf and low cost equipment. To show the effectiveness of our setup, we present new, unpublished firmware extraction attacks on six microcontrollers from three major manufacturers: STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments and Renesas Electronics that, in 2016 declared a market of \$1.5 billion, \$800 million and \$2.5 billion on units sold, respectively. Among the presented attacks, the most challenging ones exploit multiple vulnerabilities and inject over one million glitches, heavily leveraging on the performance and repeatability of the new proposed technique. We perform a thorough evaluation of arbitrary glitch waveforms by comparing the attack performance against two other major V-FI techniques in the literature. Along a responsible disclosure policy, all the vulnerabilities have been timely reported to the manufacturers.},

Although DRAM becomes less reliable when it is not refreshed, it is not immediately erased, and its contents persist sufficiently for malicious (or forensic) acquisition of usable full-system memory images. We show that this phenomenon limits the ability of an operating system to protect cryptographic key material from an attacker with physical access to a machine. It poses a particular threat to laptop users who rely on disk encryption: we demonstrate that it could be used to compromise several popular disk encryption products without the need for any special devices or materials. We experimentally characterize the extent and predictability of memory retention and report that remanence times can be increased dramatically with simple cooling techniques. We offer new algorithms for finding cryptographic keys in memory images and for correcting errors caused by bit decay. Though we discuss several strategies for mitigating these risks, we know of no simple remedy that would eliminate them.},

	abstract = {Many cryptographic algorithms are vulnerable to side channel analysis and several leakage models have been introduced to better understand these flaws. In 2003, Ishai, Sahai and Wagner introduced the d-probing security model, in which an attacker can observe at most d intermediate values during a processing. They also proposed an algorithm that securely performs the multiplication of 2 bits in this model, using only d(d+1)/2

random bits to protect the computation. We study the randomness complexity of multiplication algorithms secure in the d-probing model. We propose several contributions: we provide new theoretical characterizations and constructions, new practical constructions and a new efficient algorithmic tool to analyze the security of such schemes.

We start with a theoretical treatment of the subject: we propose an algebraic model for multiplication algorithms and exhibit an algebraic characterization of the security in the d-probing model. Using this characterization, we prove a linear (in d) lower bound and a quasi-linear (non-constructive) upper bound for this randomness cost. Then, we construct a new generic algorithm to perform secure multiplication in the d-probing model that only uses d+d2/4

random bits.

From a practical point of view, we consider the important cases d≤4
that are actually used in current real-life implementations and we build algorithms with a randomness complexity matching our theoretical lower bound for these small-order cases. Finally, still using our algebraic characterization, we provide a new dedicated verification tool, based on information set decoding, which aims at finding attacks on algorithms for fixed order d at a very low computational cost.},

We further present heating faults by operating the devices beyond their specified temperature ratings. The efficiency of this kind of attack is shown by a practical attack on an RSA implementation. Finally, we introduce data remanence attacks on AVR microcontrollers that exploit the Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) property of internal SRAM cells. We show how to recover parts of the internal memory and present first results on an ATmega162.

We investigate selection of supply-voltage and temperature values that are suitable for high-precision fault injection even up to a single bit. The object of our studies is an ASIC implementation of the recently presented block cipher PRINCE, for which a two-stage fault attack scheme has been suggested lately. This attack requires, on average, about four to five fault injections in well-defined locations. We show by electrical simulations that voltage-temperature points exist for which faults show up at locations required for a successful attack with a likelihood of around 0.1\%. This implies that the complete attack can be mounted by approximately 4,000 to 5,000 fault injection attempts, which is clearly feasible.},

Unless suitable countermeasures are taken, optical probing may also be used to induce errors in cryptographic computations or protocols, and to disrupt the processor’s control flow. It thus provides a powerful extension of existing glitching and fault analysis techniques. This vulnerability may pose a big problem for the industry, similar to those resulting from probing attacks in the mid-1990s and power analysis attacks in the late 1990s.},

In these early days of laser-induced fault injection, it was proven to be possible to inject single-bit faults into integrated circuits. This corresponds to the more restrictive fault model found in the fault attack bibliography. The target area under laser illumination (a few micrometers, down to 1 µm) broadly matched that of a single transistor. It was consistent with a single-bit fault model. However, since then the technology of secure devices has evolved. In current circuits even the smallest laser spots may illuminate several logic cells. This raises the question of the validity of the single-bit fault model: does it still hold? In this work, we report an assessment of its validity through experimental results obtained from circuits designed at the 28 nm CMOS technology node. We also describe the main properties of the corresponding fault model obtained from both static and dynamic experiments.},

EMP injections were performed against a software AES running on a CPU, and a hardware AES (with and without countermeasure) embedded in a FPGA. The purpose of this work was twofold: (a) reporting actual faults injection induced by EMPs in our targets and describing their main properties, (b) explaining the coupling mechanism between the antenna used to produce the EMP and the targeted circuit, which causes the faults. The obtained results revealed a localized effect of the EMP since the injected faults were found dependent on the spatial position of the antenna on top of the circuit's surface. The assumption that EMP faults are related to the violation of the target's timing constraints was also studied and ascertained thanks to the use of a countermeasure based on monitoring such timing violations.},

Indeed, it has been experimentally demonstrated that an EM pulse (EMP), produced with a high-voltage pulse generator and an injector similar to that used to perform EM analyses, was susceptible to create faults exploitable from a cryptanalysis viewpoint. An analysis of the induced faults revealed that they originated from timing constraint violations. In this context, this paper demonstrates that EM injection, performed with enhanced injectors, can produce not only timing faults but also bit-set and bit-reset faults on an IC at rest. This first result clearly extends the range of the threats associated with EM fault injection. It then demonstrates, considering two different ICs under operation: an FPGA and a modern microcontroller, that faults produced by EMP injection are not timing faults but correspond to a different model which is presented in this paper. This model allows to explain experimental results introduced in all former communications.},

Using fault injection, we determined that fewer than 15\% of single bit corruptions in processor state result in software visible errors. These failures were analyzed to identify the most vulnerable portions of the processor, which were then protected using simple low-overhead techniques. This resulted in a 75\% reduction in failures. Building upon the failure modes seen in the microarchitecture, fault injections into software were performed to investigate the level of masking that the software layer provides. Together, the baseline microarchitectural substrate and software mask more than 9 out of 10 transient faults from affecting correct program execution.},

Software fault models have been developed in an attempt to predict these faults. However, these models are often designed independently of any hardware consideration and thus raise the problem of realism. The generality of these models often cannot account for the specificities of each architecture. As a consequence, software countermeasures based on such software fault models do not guarantee an effective protection against fault attacks. Processor microarchitecture should be precisely analysed to better understand faulty behaviours. A cross-layer approach can then be developed, using conjointly hardware and software characteristics to design stronger software countermeasures with reasonable overheads. To illustrate this assumption, this paper shows actual faulty behaviours observed in a RISC-V processor RTL simulation, and shows that they can bypass countermeasures designed to protect against faults predicted by typical software fault models.},

	abstract = {Fault injection attacks are a powerful technique to influence the intended behavior of embedded systems. They can be used to exploit or bypass robust security features found in secure embedded systems. Examples of such attacks include differential fault analysis (DFA) and bypassing authentication mechanisms. An embedded system's authenticated boot chain (i.e. secure boot) is an interesting target for fault injection. The initial boot stages are of limited size which means logically exploitable vulnerabilities are not guaranteed to be present. In this paper, we introduce an ARM specific fault injection attack strategy for exploiting embedded systems where externally controlled data is loaded in the program counter (PC) register of the processor. This allows an attacker to control the target's execution flow which eventually will lead to arbitrary code execution on the target. We first simulate the attack using a common fault model, after which we demonstrate the practicality of the attack using a development platform designed around an ARM based, fast and feature rich system on chip (SOC). We conclude with an overview of effective and non-effective countermeasures against this fault injection attack technique.},

	abstract = {RISC-V is an emerging instruction-set architecture suitable for a wide variety of applications, which ranges from simple microcontrollers to high-performance CPUs. As an increasing number of commercial vendors now plans to adopt the architecture in their products, its security aspects are becoming a significant concern. For microcontroller implementations of RISC-V, one of the main security risks are attackers with direct physical access to the microchip. These physical attackers can perform highly powerful attacks that span from memory probing to power analysis up to fault injection and analysis. In this paper, we give an overview of the capabilities of attackers with direct physical device access, common threat models and attack vectors, and possible countermeasures. Besides, we discuss in more detail current approaches to secure RISC-V processors against fault injection attacks on the microchip itself. First, we show how to protect the control-flow against fault attacks by using an encrypted instruction stream and decrypting it on-the-fly in a newly added pipeline stage between the processor's fetch and decode unit. Second, we show how to protect conditional branches against fault injection by adding redundancy to the comparison operation and entangling the comparison result with the encrypted instruction stream. Finally, we discuss an approach to protect all pointers and memory accesses from tampering.},

This attack is able to deter- mine the complete 128-bit secret key of a sealed tamper-proof smart- card by generating 128 faulty cipher texts. Second, we present several implementation-dependent fault attacks on AES. These attacks rely on the observation that due to the AES's known timing analysis vulnera- bility (as pointed out by Koeune and Quisquater (KQ)), any implemen- tation of the AES must ensure a data independent timing behavior for the so called AES's xtime operation. We present fault attacks on AES based on various timing analysis resistant implementations of the xtime- operation. Our strongest attack in this direction uses a very liberal fault model and requires only 256 faulty encryptions to determine a 128-bit key.},

	abstract = {Recent discovery of security attacks in advanced processors, known as Spectre and Meltdown, has resulted in high public alertness about security of hardware. The root cause of these attacks is information leakage across covert channels that reveal secret data without any explicit information flow between the secret and the attacker. Many sources believe that such covert channels are intrinsic to highly advanced processor architectures based on speculation and out-of-order execution, suggesting that such security risks can be avoided by staying away from high-end processors. This paper, however, shows that the problem is of wider scope: we present new classes of covert channel attacks which are possible in average-complexity processors with in-order pipelining, as they are mainstream in applications ranging from Internet-of-Things to Autonomous Systems. We present a new approach as a foundation for remedy against covert channels: while all previous attacks were found by clever thinking of human attackers, this paper presents a formal method called Unique Program Execution Checking which detects and locates vulnerabilities to covert channels systematically, including those to covert channels unknown so far.},

The major requirements and problems related to the development and application of a validation methodology based on fault injection are presented and discussed. Emphasis is put on the definition, analysis, and use of the experimental dependability measures that can be obtained. The proposed methodology has been implemented through the realization of a general pin-level fault injection tool (MESSALINE), and its usefulness is demonstrated by the application of MESSALINE to the experimental validation of two systems: a subsystem of a centralized computerized interlocking system for railway control applications and a distributed system corresponding to the current implementation of the dependable communication system of the ESPRIT Delta-4 Project.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

This system can be adapted to a wide range of target systems and the faults are mainly injected in the processor pins. The injection of the faults is deterministic and can be reproduced if needed. Faults of different nature can be injected and the fault injector is able to detect whether the injected fault has produced an error or not without the requirement of feedback circuits. RIFLE can also detect specific circumstances in which the injected faults do not affect the target system. Sets of faults with specific impact on the target system can be generated. The paper also presents fault injection results showing the coverage and latency achieved with a set of simple behavior based error detection mechanisms. It is shown that up to 72,5\% of the errors can be detected with fairly simple mechanisms. Furthermore, for over 90\% of the faults the target system has behaved according to the fail-silent model, which suggests that a traditional computer equipped with simple error detection mechanisms is relatively close to a fail-silent computer.},

Reconfigurable hardware (especially FPGAs) was shown to be suitable to emulate the behaviour of a logic design and to realise fault injection. The proposed methodology for SEU injection exploits FPGAs and, contrarily to the most common fault injection techniques, realises the injection directly in the reconfigurable hardware, taking advantage of run-time reconfiguration capabilities of the device. In this case, no modification of the initial design description is needed to inject a fault, that results in avoiding hardware overheads and specific synthesis, place and route phases.},

	abstract = {FPGAs are increasingly used in safety-critical applications (e.g., in aerospace and automotive engineering). Safety standards stipulate that implemented countermeasures against run-time faults such as detection and isolation of affected components, automatic reconfiguration, and redundancy mechanisms must be adequately verified. To that end, fault injection tests by various means have been established as a suitable method. For such tests, faults can be provoked by radiation, simulation, or manipulating the design, for example, by inserting additional logic or manipulating the synthesis flow. This work briefly summarizes the various fault injection approaches with a focus on methods that are capable of stressing critical nets of a design running on actual hardware without requiring to re-synthesize. While the state-of-the-art tools can work with complex designs, they often lack controllability of the exact timing of the injection events (which is important to track the system’s response on faults in a logic simulation) and/or use a high amount of FPGA resources. To overcome these issues, we propose a resource-saving netlist-based fault injection framework Fault InJection Instrumenter (FIJI) that can target individual nets at test runtime. This paper presents FIJI’s work flow, implementation details, and an evaluation in terms of FPGA resources, timing impact, and performance during instrumentation and test execution.

These attacks are designed to extract critical information from the physical leakage of the digital circuitry such as the power consumption and electromagnetic emissions. Differential power analysis (DPA) attacks are considered the most efficient form of SCA attacks that require special types of countermeasures. Another form of attacks, known as fault analysis (FA), is based on forcing the circuit to produce faulty results in order to extract useful information about the secret. Several countermeasures have been proposed in the literature to address and mitigate SCA attacks at different levels of abstraction. They include algorithmic, gate and transistor-level countermeasures. Leakage originates at every level according to the implemented crypto system and attack methodology. Countermeasures at gate level and transistor level are more generic than those at the algorithmic level as they tend to be specialised for certain implementations. Complication of the design process increases down to the basic abstraction layers, however, gate-level countermeasures provide the balance of generality and design complication. The major state-of-the-art gate-level countermeasures against DPA and FA attacks are reviewed here.},

The presented error-correcting latch and flip-flop designs are power efficient, introduce minimal speed penalty, and employ reuse of on-chip scan design-for-testability and design-for-debug resources to minimize area overheads. Circuit simulations using a sub-90-nm technology show that the presented designs achieve more than a 20-fold reduction in cell-level soft error rate (SER). Fault injection experiments conducted on a microprocessor model further demonstrate that chip-level SER improvement is tunable by selective placement of the presented error-correcting designs. When coupled with error correction code to protect in-pipeline memories, the BISER flip-flop design improves chip-level SER by 10 times over an unprotected pipeline with the flip-flops contributing an extra 7-10.5\% in power. When only soft errors in flips-flops are considered, the BISER technique improves chip-level SER by 10 times with an increased power of 10.3\%. The error correction mechanism is configurable (i.e., can be turned on or off) which enables the use of the presented techniques for designs that can target multiple applications with a wide range of reliability requirements},

We develop a scheme to show the effectiveness of a biased fault model in the analysis of the time redundancy countermeasure. Our attack requires only faulty ciphertexts and does not assume strong adversarial powers. We successfully demonstrate our attack on simulated data and 128-bit time redundant AES implemented on Xilinx Spartan-3A FPGA.},
